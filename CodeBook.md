GETTING AND CLEANING DATA PROJECT
CODEBOOK

1. VARIABLES DESCRIPTION
After running the run_analysis.R script with the instructions found in README.md, you can get a tidy dataset with the following variables:

UserId		1, 2
	User Identificator
		1..30 Unique identifier assigned to testers.	

ActivityId	6 Levels
	Activity measured by the tester
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING
		STANDING
		LAYING

Feature Variables:
The subsequent variables correspond to the measurements made from the features of the devices:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag


For each one of these features, two statistics were selected: mean and standard deviation. Where '-XYZ' appears, it denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions; so you can expect three measurements (one for each axis). There are 8 variables with measurements in thre axis, giving us 24 columns. And 9 other variables with one just measurement; this give us 33 columns. This is for each one of the statistics calculated (mean and std), giving us 66 columns. These is the list of those 66 variables:
